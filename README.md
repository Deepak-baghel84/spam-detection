# Email Spam Detection
* This project focuses on building a machine learning model to classify emails are spam or not spam (ham). Using the Scikit-learn library, the model was trained on a dataset of labeled emails, leveraging natural language processing (NLP) techniques like text vectorization (TF-IDF) to transform the email content into a format suitable for analysis.
  
  The projects include:
  * Data preprocessing and cleaning.
  * Feature extraction using techniques like TF-IDF.
  * Model training and evaluation using various algorithms.
  * Performance metrics including accuracy precision and recall.
